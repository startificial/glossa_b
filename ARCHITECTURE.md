# Requireflow Architecture

This document outlines the architecture and key design patterns used in the Requireflow application.

## Application Overview

Requireflow is a SaaS platform for intelligent project requirement management, leveraging AI to transform software development workflows through collaborative design tools and performance-optimized infrastructure.

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon DB)
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM
- **State Management**: React Query (TanStack Query)
- **UI Components**: Custom components with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui
- **Authentication**: Session-based authentication
- **AI Integration**: Various NLP and generative AI services

## Architecture Design

The application follows a clean architecture approach with separation of concerns across multiple layers:

### Backend Architecture

```
server/
├── controllers/   # Request handlers
├── services/      # Business logic
├── repositories/  # Data access layer
├── middleware/    # Express middleware
├── config/        # Application configuration
├── utils/         # Utility functions
├── error/         # Error handling
├── types/         # TypeScript types
└── routes/        # API routes
```

#### Key Architectural Patterns

1. **Repository Pattern**: Abstracts data access logic, providing a clean separation between business logic and data access.
2. **Service Layer**: Contains business logic, orchestrates multiple repositories and external services.
3. **Controller Layer**: Handles HTTP requests, validates input, and delegates to services.
4. **Dependency Injection**: Dependencies are injected rather than created directly, improving testability.
5. **Error Handling**: Standardized error handling with custom error types.

### Frontend Architecture

```
client/
├── components/    # UI components
│   ├── ui/        # Base UI components
│   └── [feature]/ # Feature-specific components
├── hooks/         # Custom React hooks
├── pages/         # Top-level pages
├── services/      # API service layers
├── lib/           # Utility functions
├── providers/     # Context providers
└── types/         # TypeScript types
```

#### Key Frontend Patterns

1. **Component Composition**: Complex UI built from small, focused components.
2. **Custom Hooks**: Logic extraction into reusable hooks.
3. **Service Abstraction**: API calls abstracted into service layers.
4. **Suspense and Error Boundaries**: For improved loading and error states.
5. **Code Splitting**: For improved performance.

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Error Handling

Error handling is standardized across the application:

- **Backend**:
  - Custom error classes that extend a base `AppError` class
  - Centralized error middleware that formats errors before sending to the client
  - Consistent error logging

- **Frontend**:
  - Error boundaries to catch rendering errors
  - Custom hooks for API error handling
  - Toast notifications for user feedback

### Configuration Management

Configuration is managed through:

- **Backend**:
  - Environment variables with defaults
  - Central configuration module
  - Type-safe access patterns

- **Frontend**:
  - Environment variables with Vite
  - Feature flags for progressive enhancement
  - Theme configuration

### Logging

Logging is standardized across the application:

- **Backend**:
  - Structured logging with severity levels
  - Request/response logging
  - Error logging with correlation IDs

- **Frontend**:
  - Client-side logging with severity levels
  - Error tracking
  - Sensitive data redaction

### Type Safety

TypeScript is used consistently across the codebase:

- Shared types between frontend and backend
- Strict type checking
- Minimized use of `any` type
- Type utilities for common patterns

### API Communication

API communication is standardized:

- Consistent API route definitions
- Structured request/response formats
- Error handling
- Authentication/authorization checks

### Security

Security is implemented through:

- HTTPS enforcement
- CSRF protection
- Content Security Policy
- Input validation
- Rate limiting
- Secure cookie handling

## Data Flow

1. Client makes request to server
2. Request passes through middleware (auth, validation, etc.)
3. Controller receives request and validates input
4. Service layer performs business logic
5. Repository layer interacts with database
6. Response flows back through layers
7. Error handling at each step

## Performance Optimization

- **Database**: 
  - Proper indexing
  - Query optimization
  - Connection pooling

- **Backend**:
  - Caching for frequently accessed data
  - Optimized database queries
  - Asynchronous processing for lengthy operations

- **Frontend**:
  - Code splitting
  - Memoization
  - Optimized React Query configuration
  - Lazy loading

## Future Architecture Considerations

- Microservices architecture for specific features
- GraphQL API for more efficient data fetching
- WebSockets for real-time collaboration
- Serverless functions for specific workloads
