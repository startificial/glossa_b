‚úÖ Functional Requirements
1. File Upload Handling
Accept .pdf MIME types via upload or remote fetch (e.g., S3 link or HTTP URL).

Validate file size and reject PDFs over a predefined limit unless special large-file mode is enabled (e.g., 100MB soft cap).

Allow stream-based processing (not full load into memory).

2. Memory-Efficient Loading
Use lazy loading or streamed parsing via a PDF parsing library that supports page-wise or chunked access.

‚úÖ Libraries to consider:

PyMuPDF (fitz) ‚Äì Fast, memory-efficient, easy page access.

pdfplumber ‚Äì Great for precise content extraction, including table handling.

pdfminer.six ‚Äì Fine-grained control over structure, though slower.

pypdf ‚Äì Good for manipulation but weaker on semantic extraction.

üß™ Recommendation: Start with PyMuPDF and fall back to pdfplumber when higher fidelity is needed.

3. Chunking Strategy
Default: Per-page chunking (1 page = 1 chunk).

For dense or short pages, group multiple pages into a chunk if under a target token/character size (e.g., 1000‚Äì1500 words per chunk).

Support overlap windows for context preservation across chunks (e.g., sliding window of 100 words).

‚ú≥Ô∏è Optional: Let the system auto-adjust chunk sizes based on content density and tokenization metrics.

4. Content Cleaning and Extraction
Strip away the following unless explicitly requested:

Page numbers, headers/footers (use regex or layout-based heuristics).

Formatting tags (e.g., <b>, <i>, annotations).

Marginalia, watermark text, artifacts from OCR (e.g., scanned by, footer metadata).

Ensure:

Text is clean, linear, and semantic ‚Äî avoid layout-oriented parsing unless explicitly extracting tables or figures.

Detect and merge paragraphs that are split across lines due to PDF line breaks.

Normalize whitespace, remove duplicate lines and blank lines.

üîç Optional Advanced Parsing:
Detect headings and section breaks via font size or styles (available in PyMuPDF).

Recognize tables and output them as structured JSON, not plain text (requires pdfplumber).

5. Error Handling
Fail gracefully with structured error messages if:

PDF is corrupted.

Password-protected/encrypted.

Page count is zero.

Log and skip pages that cause parse errors instead of halting the entire process.
