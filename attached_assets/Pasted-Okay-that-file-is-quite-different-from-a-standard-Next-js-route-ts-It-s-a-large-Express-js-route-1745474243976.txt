Okay, that file is quite different from a standard Next.js `route.ts`. It's a large Express.js route registration file that defines many routes, middleware, and includes significant inline business logic, including complex interactions with external AI services and database operations.

Refactoring this entire 2000+ line file focusing *only* on "scalability, performance, and extensibility" within a single LLM prompt is highly ambitious and likely to yield overwhelming or incomplete results.

A better approach is to ask the LLM to **analyze the file, identify key areas for improvement based on those goals, and propose a refactoring strategy with examples of refactored patterns.**

Here's a revised prompt designed for *this specific file*:

---

**Revised Prompt for Coding LLM:**

```
You are an expert backend developer specializing in Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript, API design, Drizzle ORM, PostgreSQL, and integrating external services.

**Task:**

Analyze the provided Express.js route registration file (`registerRoutes.ts`). Your goal is to identify major areas for refactoring to improve **scalability, performance, extensibility, maintainability, and adherence to modern backend best practices**. Based on your analysis, propose a refactoring strategy and provide specific, illustrative code examples of how key patterns should be improved. **Do not attempt to refactor the entire file at once.**

**Context:**

* **Framework:** Express.js running on Node.js
* **Language:** TypeScript
* **Database:** PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM (via `db` import and potentially a custom `storage` abstraction layer)
* **Key Features:** Handles API routing for various resources (users, projects, customers, requirements, tasks, workflows, documents, etc.), includes authentication (session-based), file uploads (multer), direct database interactions, inline business logic, and integration with external AI services (Gemini, Claude, HuggingFace) for complex processing tasks (NLP, PDF/video analysis, etc.).
* **File Purpose:** Acts as the central point for defining most, if not all, API routes and related middleware for the application.

**Analysis & Refactoring Focus:**

Please analyze the provided code and focus your recommendations and examples on the following areas, keeping scalability, performance, extensibility, and best practices in mind:

1.  **Modularity & Structure:**
    * Assess the monolithic nature of the `registerRoutes` function.
    * Propose a strategy for breaking routes down by resource (e.g., using `express.Router()` in separate files like `routes/projects.routes.ts`, `routes/users.routes.ts`, etc.). Show an example of one such router file structure.
2.  **Separation of Concerns:**
    * Identify instances where significant business logic (e.g., AI processing calls, complex database operations, workflow generation logic) is embedded directly within route handlers.
    * Recommend and exemplify extracting this logic into dedicated service layers/functions (e.g., `services/project.service.ts`, `services/ai.service.ts`) or controllers. Show an example of a refactored route handler calling a service function.
3.  **Asynchronous & Long-Running Tasks:**
    * Evaluate the handling of potentially long-running operations (like file processing with `processTextFile`, `processPdfFile`, `processVideoFile`, `generateWorkflowDiagram`, `analyzeContradictions`).
    * Explain why initiating these directly in request handlers (even with `setTimeout` or async IIFEs) impacts scalability and reliability.
    * Recommend shifting these to a background job processing system (e.g., BullMQ, Agenda - just mention the concept, no need to implement the queue). Show how a route handler would *trigger* a background job instead of doing the work directly.
4.  **Error Handling:**
    * Analyze the current error handling patterns (various `try/catch` blocks, different response formats).
    * Propose a standardized, potentially centralized error handling strategy (e.g., custom error classes, a dedicated error handling middleware in Express). Provide an example of the middleware and how route handlers might throw errors.
5.  **Database Interactions:**
    * Review how Drizzle ORM (`db`) and the `storage` abstraction are used within route handlers.
    * Recommend patterns for abstracting data access further (e.g., into repositories or within the service layer) to improve testability and maintainability.
6.  **Input Validation:**
    * Assess the use of Zod (`insertUserSchema`, `loginSchema`, etc.).
    * Suggest best practices for applying validation (e.g., potentially as middleware, consistently at the start of handlers or service methods).
7.  **Code Readability & Consistency:**
    * Point out areas where consistency could be improved (e.g., response formats, variable naming, function structures).
    * Recommend consistent use of TypeScript for types/interfaces.
8.  **Configuration:**
    * Identify hardcoded values or structures (like the `/api/database-schema` response) that could be made more configurable.

**Input Code (`registerRoutes.ts`):**

```typescript
// [Paste the entire content of the provided registerRoutes.ts file here]
```

**Requested Output:**

1.  **Summary of Issues:** Briefly list the main architectural and code pattern issues identified based on the focus areas above.
2.  **Proposed Structure:** Outline a recommended project folder structure for organizing routes, services, controllers (if applicable), etc.
3.  **Refactoring Strategy & Examples:** For *each* key focus area (Modularity, Separation of Concerns, Async Tasks, Error Handling, Database, Validation):
    * Briefly explain the recommended approach.
    * Provide concise, illustrative code examples demonstrating the refactored pattern (e.g., a sample router file, a service function, an error handler, how to trigger a background job). These examples should be based on patterns found in the input code but significantly simplified to show the concept clearly.
4.  **High-Level Recommendations:** Conclude with any other overarching suggestions for improving the backend codebase based on the provided file.

**Important:** Focus on providing a clear strategy and actionable, illustrative examples of the refactored patterns, rather than attempting a full rewrite of the entire file.

This prompt directs the LLM to act as an architect, analyzing the existing code, identifying problems related to your goals (scalability, performance, etc.), and providing a strategic plan with concrete examples of *how* to refactor, which is much more achievable and useful for such a large file.
