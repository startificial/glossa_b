Customer Requirements Document: Migration of [Old System Name] to [New System Name]
(Continuing from Section 10...)
* PM-003 (Monitoring): Key performance indicators (KPIs) for system health, performance, and usage must be monitored and reported to the customer [Specify frequency, e.g., daily during hypercare, weekly for the first month, then monthly]. Specific KPIs required include: [e.g., System uptime, average transaction response time, error rates, CPU/Memory utilization].
* PM-004 (Knowledge Transfer): Comprehensive documentation must be provided to the [Customer Name] IT team covering:
   * System architecture overview.
   * Standard operating procedures (backups, monitoring, user admin).
   * Troubleshooting guide for common issues.
   * Configuration details. A knowledge transfer session/training must be conducted for the customer's support staff before the end of the hypercare period.
* PM-005 (Legacy System Decommissioning): A plan for the decommissioning of the Legacy System infrastructure must be provided. Execution of decommissioning will only occur after formal customer sign-off on the migration project's success and completion of the hypercare period, following [Customer's internal asset disposal/archiving procedures].
11. Constraints & Assumptions
11.1 Constraints:
* C-001 (Budget): The migration project must adhere to the allocated budget of [Specify Budget Amount or refer to separate financial agreement]. All activities must be performed within this constraint.
* C-002 (Timeline): The target go-live date is [Specify Date, e.g., Q4 2025]. Key milestones leading to this date must be met. Any delays require formal change request approval.
* C-003 (Technology): The Target System is [Specify System, e.g., Salesforce Platform, SAP S/4HANA, a specific SaaS application]. Solutions must leverage the standard capabilities of this platform unless explicitly approved otherwise. [Mention any constraints on customization or specific tech stack components].
* C-004 (Resources): [Customer Name] will provide access to Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and Key Users for requirements clarification, testing, and training for a maximum of [Specify hours/percentage] of their time during the project lifecycle. Availability must be scheduled in advance.
* C-005 (Third-Party): Dependencies on [mention any third-party vendors or systems] must be managed within existing agreements or defined project scope.
11.2 Assumptions:
* A-001: The [Migration Project Team/Vendor Name] has the necessary expertise and resources to perform the migration successfully.
* A-002: The underlying infrastructure (network, servers, cloud environment) required for the Target System will be available and meet the specifications required by the Target System vendor by [Specify Date or Milestone].
* A-003: Data in the Legacy System is reasonably accurate and complete for the scope defined in Section 8. Significant data cleansing efforts beyond those specified are out of scope unless identified and approved via change control.
* A-004: Access credentials, documentation, and necessary support for the Legacy System will be provided by [Customer Name] to the migration team in a timely manner.
* A-005: [Customer Name] stakeholders will be available for required meetings, reviews, approvals, and UAT participation according to the agreed project schedule.
* A-006: Standard functionalities of the Target System will meet the majority of the functional requirements, minimizing the need for extensive customization.
12. Acceptance Criteria Overview
The overall migration project will be considered successful and accepted by [Customer Name] upon meeting the following high-level criteria. Detailed acceptance criteria for each specific requirement (Functional, Non-Functional, Data Migration) must be documented in the project's Test Plan(s) and agreed upon prior to testing phases.
* AC-001: All Functional Requirements (Section 6) are demonstrated to work correctly in the Target System during User Acceptance Testing (UAT), and UAT is formally signed off by the designated customer representatives.
* AC-002: All Non-Functional Requirements (Section 7) are met, as verified through performance testing, security audits, and operational monitoring during UAT and the hypercare period.
* AC-003: Data Migration (Section 8) is completed successfully, with data validation results (record counts, spot checks, control figures) meeting the agreed-upon thresholds, and formal sign-off on the Data Validation Report is received from the customer.
* AC-004: The Cutover (Section 9) is executed successfully within the planned downtime window, with no critical issues preventing business operations on the Target System.
* AC-005: Post-Migration Support (Section 10), including hypercare and knowledge transfer, is delivered as specified.
* AC-006: All required project documentation (e.g., mapping documents, test plans, final reports, support documentation) is delivered and approved by the customer.
13. Glossary
* Cutover: The process of switching from the Legacy System to the Target System, making the Target System the live production environment.
* Data Migration: The process of transferring data from the Legacy System to the Target System.
* Data Validation: The process of verifying the accuracy and completeness of migrated data.
* Downtime: The period during which a system is unavailable for use.
* Functional Requirement: A requirement specifying what the system must do.
* Go-Live: The point in time when the Target System becomes operational for end-users.
* Hypercare: A period of intensified support immediately following go-live.
* Legacy System: The existing system being replaced ([Old System Name]).
* Non-Functional Requirement: A requirement specifying how well the system must perform (e.g., performance, security, availability).
* RPO (Recovery Point Objective): The maximum acceptable amount of data loss in case of a disaster, measured in time.
* RTO (Recovery Time Objective): The maximum acceptable time to restore system functionality after a disaster.
* Rollback: The process of reverting to the previous state (i.e., the Legacy System) if the cutover fails.
* Scope: The defined boundaries of the project – what is included and excluded.
* SME (Subject Matter Expert): An individual with deep knowledge of a specific business process or the Legacy System.
* Stakeholder: An individual or group with an interest in the project's outcome.
* Target System: The new system being implemented ([New System Name]).
* UAT (User Acceptance Testing): Testing conducted by end-users to verify the system meets business requirements in real-world scenarios.
